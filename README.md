## Description

The purpose of the application is to allow developers to publish articles, blog posts, thougts and opinions, and comment on other developers posts. 

It follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
